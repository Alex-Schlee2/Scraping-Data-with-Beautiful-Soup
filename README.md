### Project Goal and Procedure
* Goal: Build a Logistic Regression Model to predict Cocktails based on selected ingredients
* Scraped cocktail information from [www.bbcgoodfood.com](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/)  
* Dataset was scraped using Python and BeautifulSoup
* Saved results in a csv file and opened with Python's pandas package

### Code and Resources
* Python Version: 3.8
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
* Packages: Beautiful Soup, Matplotlib, Pandas

# Scraping Data using Beautiful Soup
The relevant data for the dataset was extracted by using Beautiful Soup. I wrote a script which was able to scrape the following information:
* Cocktail name
* amount of calories per serving
* amount of sugar information
* description (includes the ingredients which will be extracted in the future steps)

#### I extracted the mentioned information for each cocktail one by one and concatenated the outputs in the last step, so that the pandas dataframe looks like this:
